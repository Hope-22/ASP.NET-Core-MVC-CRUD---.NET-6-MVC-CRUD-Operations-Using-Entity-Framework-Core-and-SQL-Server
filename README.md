ASP.NET-Core-MVC-CRUD---.NET-6-MVC-CRUD-Operations-Using-Entity-Framework-Core-and-SQL-Server
Created an ASP.NET MVC CRUD app using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server.

This is a Model View Controller pattern which is a very famous architectural pattern in software design,
And it is equally popular when clubbed together with the ASP.NET framework
Used Bootstrap 5 in this ASP.NET MVC website to style the pages.
